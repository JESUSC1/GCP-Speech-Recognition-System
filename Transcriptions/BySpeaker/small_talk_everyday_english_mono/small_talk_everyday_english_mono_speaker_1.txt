Speaker 1: So what's new Mark, how is your new job going? To be honest, I can't complain. I really love the company that I am working for. My coworkers are all really friendly and helpful. They really help me feel welcome. It's a really energetic and fun atmosphere. My boss is hilarious, and he's really flexible. Really How so? He allows me to come in when I want and make my own hours. I can also leave early. If I start early, there is no real dress code either. I can wear jeans and a t-shirt if I want I can even wear shorts in the summer. Wow it sounds really cool. I can't stand wearing a suit every day which do you prefer working late or finishing early? I prefer finishing early. I really enjoyed the morning. I love getting up early and going for a run. There's nothing like watching the sunrise while drinking my morning coffee. Really. I am opposite. I love sleeping in. I am most Alert in the evenings. I'm a real night owl. Well, you know what, they say, the early bird catches the worm, you know, you could be right? Maybe I will try to go to bed a little earlier tonight.
